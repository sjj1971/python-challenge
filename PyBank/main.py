# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

# The total number of months included in the dataset

# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

# The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
# Financial Analysis
# ----------------------------
# Total Months: 86
# Total: $38382578
# Average  Change: $-2315.12
# Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
# Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)


# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
